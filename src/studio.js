// `sources` is written out by hand here, and deliberately so. The template globs
// the folder -- `sourcesFrom(import.meta.glob('./sources/**/*.jsx'))` -- which is
// what a studio should normally do, since adding a graphic is then adding a file.
// Keeping the map here means both paths stay covered by something: the explicit one
// through these end-to-end suites, and the globbed one through the chunk check in
// scripts/verify-template.mjs.
//
// It also lets a key demonstrate grouping without renaming the file behind it.
